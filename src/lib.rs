//!
//! Stele is a collection of tools in rust and python for preserving,
//! authenticating, and accessing laws in perpetuity.
//!
//! ## About the name
//!
//! Stelae, or large stone slabs, were used in some ancient cultures to

//! written laws, was published on a Stele in ~1750 BCE and is still readable
//! nearly four millennia later.
